## Overview

I will introduce you to RStudio and GitHub. I will show you a variety of approaches for organizing your projects that involve code and show you how to use GitHub without having to learn Git. If you already use RStudio and GitHub, skip this week as this will be introductory level. If you have tried RStudio or GitHub and gotten frustrated or thought 'I don't have time to learn this', this is for you. If you want to learn how to easily keep track of changes in your code, this is for you. If you have never used RStudio, this is for you.

I'm going to show you how to work with Git/GitHub with no command-line interface. The goal is to futz with Git as little as possible. See the Links tab above for a nice online workshop on Git/GitHub if you want to learn more.


## RStudio Overview

When you open RStudio you will see 4 panels:

## Create an RStudio Project

1. In RStudio, choose "File->New Project..."
1. Then choose "New Directory" and then choose "Empty Project"
1. In the next dialog, choose a name (_it is best to  use only letters, numbers, dashes, and underscores, and include no spaces in the name_).  
1. Then click "Create Project".

That should give you a new project.

## Add a new script file

1. Add a new file using 'File > New File > R Script'
2. Or you can click the new icon in top left corner.
2. Add some code to that file. Copy and paste in:

```
require(graphics)
## Annette Dobson (1990) "An Introduction to Generalized Linear Models".
## Page 9: Plant Weight Data.
ctl <- c(4.17,5.58,5.18,6.11,4.50,4.61,5.17,4.53,5.33,5.14)
trt <- c(4.81,4.17,4.41,3.59,5.87,3.83,6.03,4.89,4.32,4.69)
group <- gl(2, 10, 20, labels = c("Ctl","Trt"))
weight <- c(ctl, trt)
lm.D9 <- lm(weight ~ group)
opar <- par(mfrow = c(2,2), oma = c(0, 0, 1.1, 0))
plot(lm.D9, las = 1)      # Residuals, Fitted, ...
par(opar)
```

## Run the code

1. Select all the lines of code and select 'Run'
2. Run all the code by selecting 'Source'

## Compartmentalize: Use Projects

Keep your projects in separate folders with a uniform set of folder names. For example,

* R - your functions
* scripts - scripts (so not functions)
* data - your RData files
* output -
* inst - random stuff
* notes -

The top right corner allows you to create projects and switch between projects.

### Project settings

Key one is to **not** save your `.Rdata` (your environment) when your are done for the day.  Under Tools > Project Options... > General

### Super helpful features

* Edit > Find in Files...
* Code > Comment
* Code > Reindent Lines
* File > New (templates)
* History tab
* Help tab (index at bottom)
* Help > Markdown quick reference












## More exercises

R for Data Science is a great book to introduce you to working with data in R. Read through the following sections of the R for Data Science book and work through the examples.

* [Workflow basics](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-basics.html): super basic review on how R works.
* [Workflow: projects](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html): info about organizing RStudio projects.
* [Workflow: scripts](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-scripts.html):  how to evaluate code in scripts.
