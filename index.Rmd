title: "Practical R Workflow for Scientists June-July 2021"

These short sessions (45min to 1hr) will be focused on tools and practices for NMFS scientists to help you be **faster, more efficient and organized** in your coding and in merging reports with code. The focus of these workshops is practical skills and tools. Each session will be stand-alone. While the sessions will be introductory, I will give you links to my GitHub repositories that illustrate more complex examples (and that you can copy and build on). Two sessions will duplicates of the [2020](https://github.com/RVerse-Tutorials/RWorkflow-NWFSC-2020) sessions, but the rest are new topics or cover the same topics in different ways.

**Target audience**: You already code in R, maybe use RStudio too, but want to learn some tips about being more efficient from a seasoned R programmer who does the kind of coding and work that you do.

**About me**: I am a modeler/applied mathematician and I am immersed in R. I develop R packages for public use. I teach time-series analysis at the University of Washington (using R) and I teach workshops on R and reproducible research.

## Set-up for the workshop

Before the workshops, go to [Set-up](set-up.html) for instructions. Unless you will only be listening, you'll need a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account. To actively participate in the activities, you'll want either R, RStudio and GitHub Desktop installed on your computer or you can use [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/). If you do the latter, you don't need to install any software.

## Video and GitHub Organization links for the sessions

Please email Eli (eli.holmes@noaa.gov) from your NOAA email, and I will send you the WebEx links and link to the GitHub Classroom. It is the same link for each session.

## Topics

* [Week 1](week1.html) Introduction to workflow using RStudio and Git/GitHub. The session video will be posted June 2nd but the link has my lectures notes and short videos of the skills. [Lecture notes and video link](week1.html)

* Week 2. More Git/GitHub/GitLab. How to use issues, releases and project boards to be more efficient either working alone or in a team.

* Week 3. Rmarkdown for reports. Let's make a report that updates when our data change.

* Week 4. Making plots with ggplot2. Learning ggplot2 will make it much easier to make plots from the big and complex datasets that you deal with on a daily basis.

* Week 5. Making raster plots with the raster and tmap packages. Working with spatial data is a huge area. We are going to start gently by making raster plots and using the tmap package. You'll see how easy it easy to make maps of data on a grid.

* Week 6. Creating a data R package. I show you how to make a basic data package that allows you to version and document your data.

* Week 7. Clustering tools in R

* Week 8. Creating landing pages using RStudio/R Markdown/GitHub and R packages landing pages using pkgdown.
