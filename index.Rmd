title: "Practical R Workflow for Scientists June-July 2021"

<img style="float: right;" src="images/tools-logo-transparent.png" width=30%>

These short sessions (45min to 1hr) will be focused on tools and practices for NMFS scientists to help you be **faster, more efficient and organized** in your coding and in merging reports with code. The focus of these workshops is practical skills and tools. Each session will be stand-alone. While the sessions will be introductory, I will give you links to my GitHub repositories that illustrate more complex examples (and that you can copy and build on). Two sessions will duplicates of the [2020](https://github.com/RVerse-Tutorials/RWorkflow-NWFSC-2020) sessions, but the rest are new topics or cover the same topics in different ways.

**Target audience**: You already code in R, maybe use RStudio too, but want to learn some tips about being more efficient from a seasoned R programmer who does the kind of coding and work that you do.

**About me**: I am a modeler/applied mathematician and I am immersed in R. I develop R packages for public use. I teach time-series analysis at the University of Washington (using R) and I teach workshops on R and reproducible research.

## Set-up for the workshop

Before the workshops, go to [Set-up](set-up.html) for instructions. Unless you will only be listening, you'll need a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account. To actively participate in the activities, you'll want either R, RStudio and GitHub Desktop installed on your computer or you can use [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/). If you do the latter, you don't need to install any software.

## Video and GitHub Organization links for the sessions

Please email Eli (eli.holmes@noaa.gov) from your NOAA email, and I will send you the WebEx links and link to the GitHub Classroom. It is the same link for each session.

## Topics

* [Week 1](week1-rstudio.html). Introduction to workflow using RStudio and Git/GitHub. The session video will be posted June 2nd. Here are some shorter videos of the instructions.
    * Connecting GitHub Desktop to your GitHub account. [Video](https://youtu.be/AiRrSwQte5k)
    * Making a repo on GitHub and getting that into RStudio and GitHub Desktop [Video]()
    * Connecting Git and RStudio. You can use Git inside RStudio (I do sometimes) but for 25% of people there is much suffering going this route while the set-up using GitHub Desktop is fast and easy for most people. Here are the instructions if you want to go that route. [Notes](https://rverse-tutorials.github.io/RWorkflow-NWFSC-2020/set-up.html#Set_up_RStudio_to_use_Git), [Tutorial](https://happygitwithr.com/install-intro.html), [Video overview of the steps](https://youtu.be/2QJQ6pNroVM).

* Week 2. More Git/GitHub/GitLab. How to use issues, releases and project boards to be more efficient either working alone or in a team.

* Week 3. Rmarkdown for reports. Let's make a report that updates when our data change.

* Week 4. Making plots with ggplot2. Learning ggplot2 will make it much easier to make plots from the big and complex datasets that you deal with on a daily basis.

* Week 5. Making raster plots with the raster and tmap packages. Working with spatial data is a huge area. We are going to start gently by making raster plots and using the tmap package. You'll see how easy it easy to make maps of data on a grid.

* Week 6. Creating a data R package. I show you how to make a basic data package that allows you to version and document your data.

* Week 7. Clustering tools in R

* Week 8. Introduction to benchmarking and debugging your code
