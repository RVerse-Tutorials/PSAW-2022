Note this is not specific to R in any way nor to computer coding per se. I will use RStudio to edit my files in the session, but you can use whatever you want to edit files.

* [Part 2](git-part2.html). GitHub skills. We'll learn how to use issues and releases on GitHub to be more efficient either working alone or in a team. I'll show you how I use organizations to organize my repositories and some of the nice 'landing page' features of GitHub.

* [Part 3](git-part3.html). More Git skills. Dealing with merge conflicts.

* [Using Git from RStudio](Git-RStudio.html) Introduction to workflow using RStudio and Git/GitHub.

Note RStudio Cloud is currently specific to R and RStudio in the free mode. They are rolling out a Jupyter option (Python), but that is in beta and you have to pay (a lot).

* [Part 1](rstudiocloud-part1.html). Introduction to RStudio Cloud for individuals.

* [Part 2](rstudiocloud-part2.html). RStudio Cloud for instructors or those wanting to share code or collaborate on code.
