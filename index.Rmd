title: "Practical R Workflow for Scientists May-June 2020"

<img style="float: right;" src="images/tools-logo-transparent.png" width=30%>

These short sessions (45min to 1hr) will be focused on tools and practices for NMFS scientists to help you be **faster, more efficient and organized** in your coding and in merging reports with code. The focus of these workshops is practical skills and tools. Each session will be stand-alone. While the sessions will be introductory, I will give you links to my GitHub repositories that illustrate more complex examples (and that you can copy and build on).

**Target audience**: You already code in R, maybe use RStudio too, but want to learn some tips about being more efficient from a seasoned NWFSC R programmer who does the kind of coding and work that you do.

**About me**: I am a modeler/applied mathematician and I am immersed in R. I develop R packages for public use. I teach time-series analysis at the University of Washington (using R) and I teach workshops on R and reproducible research.

## Set-up

You can just watch or if you want to try out what I am showing, go to [Set-up](https://rverse-tutorials.github.io/RWorkflow-NWFSC-2020/set-up.html) and install the needed applications (RStudio + GitHub Desktop).
