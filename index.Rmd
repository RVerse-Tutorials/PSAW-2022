## Introduction to Git/GitHub Jan 12

Note this is not specific to R in any way nor to computer coding per se. I will use RStudio to edit my files in the session, but you can use whatever you want to edit files.

* [Part 1](git-part1.html). The key Git skills. These basic skills are all you need for 95% of your work with Git repositories.

* [Part 2](git-part2.html). GitHub skills. We'll learn how to use issues and releases on GitHub to be more efficient either working alone or in a team. I'll show you how I use organizations to organize my repositories and some of the nice 'landing page' features of GitHub.

* [Part 3](git-part3.html). More Git skills. Dealing with merge conflicts.

* [Using Git from RStudio](Git-RStudio.html) Introduction to workflow using RStudio and Git/GitHub.


## Introduction to RStudio Cloud Jan 12

Note RStudio Cloud is currently specific to R and RStudio in the free mode. They are rolling out a Jupyter option (Python), but that is in beta and you have to pay (a lot).

* [Part 1](rstudiocloud-part1.html). Introduction to RStudio Cloud for individuals.

* [Part 2](rstudiocloud-part2.html). RStudio Cloud for instructors or those wanting to share code or collaborate on code.


<!--
### Building a Data R Packages

* [Part 1](week6.html). Intro to R packages for data and code. How to build an R package in RStudio. In the second half of the lecture, I will show you how to make an R data package and what that can do to allow data documentation, data revision tracking, data versioning and data sharing.

* [Part 2](week7.html). Intro to **roxygen2** for documentation and **pkgdown** for package websites. Even if you don't do the coding on your team, you should be aware of how documentation works so you can contribute and the tools for automating tasks like a project website so your team doesn't fall into inefficient workflows.

* [Part 3](week8.html). Advanced topics for developers. How to set up a NAMESPACE, passing `R CMD check`, debugging tools, coding GitHub Actions workflows, C++ code in your package. I am going to pass on tips to help you understand how these things work so you don't waste hours figuring it out or fall back on hacky solutions.
