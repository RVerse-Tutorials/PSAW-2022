title: "Practical R Workflow for Scientists May-June 2020"

<img style="float: right;" src="images/tools-logo-transparent.png" width=30%>

These short sessions (45min to 1hr) will be focused on tools and practices for NMFS scientists to help you be **faster, more efficient and organized** in your coding and in merging reports with code. The focus of these workshops is practical skills and tools. Each session will be stand-alone. While the sessions will be introductory, I will give you links to my GitHub repositories that illustrate more complex examples (and that you can copy and build on).

**Target audience**: You already code in R, maybe use RStudio too, but want to learn some tips about being more efficient from a seasoned NWFSC R programmer who does the kind of coding and work that you do.

**About me**: I am a modeler/applied mathematician and I am immersed in R. I develop R packages for public use. I teach time-series analysis at the University of Washington (using R) and I teach workshops on R and reproducible research.

## Topics

* [Week 1](week1-rstudio.html). Introduction to workflow using RStudio and Git/GitHub/GitLab [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxIpxVdQsDs)

* [Week 2](week2-coding.html). More Git/GitHub/GitLab + Basic coding practices for reproducible and extendible code [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0P3e39qcA4)

* [Week 3](week3-RMarkdown.html). Rmarkdown for reports: how to do big tables and export formats for Word docs [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGc2cgMFoPs)

* [Week 4](week4-packages.html). Part 1. Organizing your R code into a package [Video](https://youtu.be/6d62KvS5v7Q)

* [Week 5](week5-roxygen.html). Part 2. Documenting your code and data with Roxygen [Video](https://youtu.be/zHPSbhGtkz4)

*Unfortunately at about 40min in, I managed to corrupt my R packages and could not demo any more so covered the material verbally. The problem demonstrates why I try to have few dependencies in my packages! One of the dependencies in my* **SardineForecast** *package had an install problem and corrupted the* **pkgload** *package.*

* [Week 6](week6-more-packages.html). Part 3. Vignettes and plot/print methods for your package. [Video](https://youtu.be/O4rojT7aeb0)
