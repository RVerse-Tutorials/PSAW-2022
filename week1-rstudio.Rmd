# Overview

I will introduce you to RStudio and GitHub and show you how to use GitHub without having to learn Git. If you already use RStudio and Git, you can skip this week as this will be introductory level. If you have tried RStudio or Git and gotten frustrated or thought 'I don't have time to learn this', this is for you. If you want to learn how to easily keep track of changes in your code, this is for you. If you have never used RStudio, this is for you.

I'm going to show you how to work with Git/GitHub with no command-line interface using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). See the [More Resources](links.html) tab above for a [nice online workshop](https://happygitwithr.com/) on Git/GitHub if you want to learn more. If you want to learn to use Git with RStudio, see the same workshop or my [2020 set-up info](https://rverse-tutorials.github.io/RWorkflow/set-up.html#Git_from_RStudio).

# RStudio

Open RStudio on your computer or on RStudio Cloud. To do the latter, click this link: https://rstudio.cloud/project/2574104

When you open RStudio you will see 4 panels:

![RStudio-panels](images/RStudio-screenshot.png)

## Create an RStudio Project

**On the desktop app**

1. In RStudio, choose "File->New Project..."
1. Then choose "New Directory" and then choose "Empty Project"
1. In the next dialog, choose a name (_it is best to  use only letters, numbers, dashes, and underscores, and include no spaces in the name_).  
1. Then click "Create Project".

![RStudio-panels](images/RStudio-screenshot.png)

**On RStudio Cloud**

1. On left, click 'Your Workspace"
1. Then click New Project (blue button on right)

![RStudio-panels](images/RStudio-Cloud-screenshot.png)

### Add a new script file

1. Add a new file using 'File > New File > R Script'
2. Or you can click the new icon in top left corner.
2. Add some code to that file. Copy and paste in:

```
require(graphics)
## Annette Dobson (1990) "An Introduction to Generalized Linear Models".
## Page 9: Plant Weight Data.
ctl <- c(4.17,5.58,5.18,6.11,4.50,4.61,5.17,4.53,5.33,5.14)
trt <- c(4.81,4.17,4.41,3.59,5.87,3.83,6.03,4.89,4.32,4.69)
group <- gl(2, 10, 20, labels = c("Ctl","Trt"))
weight <- c(ctl, trt)
lm.D9 <- lm(weight ~ group)
opar <- par(mfrow = c(2,2), oma = c(0, 0, 1.1, 0))
plot(lm.D9, las = 1)      # Residuals, Fitted, ...
par(opar)
```

### Run the code

1. Select all the lines of code and select 'Run'
2. Run all the code by selecting 'Source'

## Project organization

Keep your projects in separate folders with a uniform set of folder names. For example,

* R - your R code
* data - your data files
* output -
* inst - random stuff
* notes -

### Project settings

One tip is to **not** save your `.Rdata` (your environment) when your are done for the day.  Under Tools > Project Options... > General

## Super helpful features

* Edit > Find in Files...
* Code > Comment
* Code > Reindent Lines
* File > New (templates)
* History tab
* Help tab (index at bottom)
* Help > Markdown quick reference

## More exercises

R for Data Science is a great book to introduce you to working with data in R. Read through the following sections of the R for Data Science book and work through the examples.

* [Workflow basics](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-basics.html): super basic review on how R works.
* [Workflow: projects](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html): info about organizing RStudio projects.
* [Workflow: scripts](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-scripts.html):  how to evaluate code in scripts.

# Git (GitHub/GitLab)

Tracking your code (and project) changes. Today, I am focusing on Git for individuals **not teams**. If you aren't using a change tracker (version control) already, then start just with a personal project and track only your changes. I also will not cover *branches* today.

## Basics

* Repo: Repository. It is your code and the record of your changes. In a hidden folder called `.git` (so if you wanted to get rid of the history and other Git info, you could delete that folder). You have a local repo and a remote repo (on GitHub/GitLab).
* Actions: Commit, Push, Pull
* Git: The program that keeps track of the changes on local and remote("origin") repo.
* Git GUIs: A graphical interface for Git (which is command line). There are [many](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis). I am teaching an easy-entry one, [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).

One-person Workflow (to get started):

* Make local changes to code.
* Record what those changes were about and commit to the code change record (history).
* Push those changes to your remote repository (aka origin)

![First foray into Git](images/git-intro.png)

Goals today:

1. Get you started.
2. Show you a simple workflow.
3. Show some simple GitHub features.

## Let's get started!

I am going to show a workflow that is usually robust. Connecting Git on your computer and GitHub is a source of much misery, and in my experience **creating the repo on GitHub first** eliminates the problems. This really important for the first time you connect your computer to the remote repository server (GitHub). 

### Make a GitHub Repo

1. Go to GitHub and create a new repository (the + in the top right)
2. Click add Readme.md and add .gitignore (type R to get the R .gitignore)
3. Copy the url of your new repo

### Add the new repo to RStudio

**On the desktop app**

1. Open RStudio and click `New Project` (upper right, blue cube with R)
2. Click New Project... > Version Control > Git and paste in the url. Give your project a name and make sure the directory is where you want the project.
3. Done!

**On the RStudio Cloud**

1. Click 'Your Workspace' on left
2. Click New Project > New Project from Git Repository. Paste in the url.
3. Done!

### Make some changes and commit

1. Add a file. File > New File > R Script
2. Type something and then save the file.
3. Click the `Git` tab in the upper right.
4. Click the changes that you want to commit (do all). And click `Commit`. Add a comment: first line is subject, newline, description (options).
5. Click the Green up arrow to Push to GitHub.

**Giving Git your email and name**

1. Click the Terminal tab in the lower left panel (R Studio Cloud) or click the blue cog below the Git tab in the upper right panel (R Studio Desktop).
2. Type in this with your info
```
git config --global user.email "<your email>"
git config --global user.name "<your name>"
```
3. You only have to do this once

**If it asks for your GitHub user name and password**

Enter. Hopefully you only have to do this once. *Note: you may get an email from GitHub complaining about accessing GitHub via password. Ignore but accessing GitHub from RStudio may stop working in the future.*

### Make some changes and look at the history

1. Repeat 1-4 a few times.
2. Now look at the history. The little clock-like icon (or History in the Git window). 
   
   * Click on `filter by file` to see just the changes to one file.
   * Do a search in the upper right.
   * Click on an early commit and click `View file @...`
   
3. Push changes up the GitHub

## Copy someone's else repo to your GitHub account

Don't Fork. That would be if you are contributing to their repo. If you just want to copy it and then adapt it for your purposes, do this.

1. In a browser, navigate to the repository that you want to copy. For example: https://github.com/RVerse-Tutorials/Test.
2. Copy its url.
3. Open GitHub and go to your account. So for me, I would go to github.com/eeholmes because my account is eeholmes. 
4. If using GitHub, click the `+` in top right and click `import repository`. Paste in the url and give your repo a name.
5. Open RStudio and click the project tab in the top right and select, `New Project`. Then select `Version Control` and paste in the url of **your** repository's url.  For example, `https://github.com/<youraccount>/Test` or 
`https://gitlab.com/<youraccount>/Test` or 
6. Add the new repo to GitHub Desktop. Open GitHub Desktop, select File>Add Local Repository and navigate to the folder with the new repository.

## Key tips

1. Avoid making changes on GitHub  directly.

  * Waa, I did and then I forget to pull and now I have merge conflicts. What do I do?? I warned you. Now, go to the advanced Git material in the tab above to learn how to deal with merge conflicts.
  
2. Do not use branches (wait till you are friends with Git).

3. Do not use Git at the command line.

4. If you use Dropbox or iCloud on multiple computers to keep folders synced up across different computers, don't put your GitHub repos in those folders.

5. The Git info is in the hidden folder `.git`. If you need to get rid of the repository data (like history), delete that. Don't copy that folder into another repo.

6. Start by making a blank repo on GitHub and select the box to add a Readme file. Then clone that with RStudio or GitHub Desktop.
 
# GitHub Desktop

Despite the name, it works with GitLab too.

You can commit your changes and push them with RStudio only, but many people use a Git GUI to interact with Git and their remote repository. GitHub Desktop is simple and works well.  Why not just use RStudio? If you are happy with that, fine. Many people prefer a separate Git GUI, though Git with RStudio has improved and serves many just fine.

## Adding your local repository

To use your local repository with GitHub Desktop, you need to add it.

1. File > Add Local Repository.

How does it know what the remote repository (GitHub/GitLab) is? It is stored in the .git information which was set when you cloned the repo from GitHub.

## Adding your GitHub repository

If you have a repository on GitHub that you want to add to your local computer:

1. File > Clone Repository.

You'll see a window with 3 tabs. The first one is GitHub and shows you your own repositories. The 3rd one is URL and don't use that until you know your way around Git quite well. Use the instructions I gave above on cloning to GitHub and then pulling in your own repo to your local computer.

## NOAA Info

For NOAA staff, GitHub can be used for publishing public projects:
[NOAA GitHub](https://github.com/NOAAGov/NOAA-Affiliated-Projects) and a NWFSC example
[NWFSC Timeseries](https://nwfsc-timeseries.github.io/). NWFSC has a GitHub internal server if you want a repository server for your non-public projects and for internal collaboration.
